Slot Machine were your bet amount is always 10 credits. There are only two spinning options; "Spin Middle Row" or "Spin All". The "Spin Middle Row" button will make the middle row the only row to be randomized and scored. A win would result in 100 credits. The "Spin All" button will randomize every slot and score horizontal and diagonal rows. A win using the "Spin All" button would result in 20 credits.
